Three Hypothesis Tests:

1. People want a powerful, yet simplistic interface to analyze text.
2. People are not willing to pay in order to receive these NLP features.
3. People lack a complete understanding of Natural Language Processing and itâ€™s various uses.

Testing the Hypothesis:

1.
Do you think that the layout for various NLP websites are intuitive and easy to use?

Do you feel that the visualization of the dependency-based parsed tree is neat, accurate, and easily understood?

Are the labelling and explanation of the parts of speech useful features for analyzing the text?

2.
Would you purchase a premium membership to use these features?

What is the maximum amount of money you would pay to be able to use ClearViz?

3.
Can you explain the concepts of Natural Language Processing and how and why it is used?

Do you feel the need of a complete tutorial on how to use the dependency-based parse tree?
