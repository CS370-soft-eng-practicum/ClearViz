Three Hypothesis Tests:

1. People want a powerful, yet simplistic interface to analyze text.
2. People are not willing to pay in order to receive these NLP features.
3. People lack a complete understanding of Natural Language Processing and itâ€™s various uses.

Testing the Hypothesis:

1.
Do you think that the layout for various NLP websites are intuitive and easy to use?

Do you feel that the visualization of the dependency-based parsed tree is neat, accurate, and easily understood?

Are the labelling and explanation of the parts of speech useful features for analyzing the text?

2.
Would you purchase a premium membership to use these features?


3.
Do you feel the need of a complete tutorial on how to use the dependency-based parse tree?

Conclusion/Observations:

Based on the information that we have gathered, we can see that those who are associated with natural language processing overall think that the layout of ClearViz is mostly intuitive. Some ran into confusion as there was no help or guide on how to use the site. In addition, it was mentioned that the UI felt a bit clunky. However, everyone felt that the visualization of the dependency-based parsed tree was neat and easily understood.

Interestingly, it was found that those associated with NLP were willing to buy a premium membership to use these features.
